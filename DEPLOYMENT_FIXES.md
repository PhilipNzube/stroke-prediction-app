# Deployment Fixes Guide

This document explains the fixes applied for the deployment issues.

## Issue 1: Backend Model Loading on Render

### Problem

The backend was showing "model not loaded" errors on Render deployment.

### Root Cause

- Model loading logic had path resolution issues
- Relative paths weren't working correctly in the Render environment
- The WSGI application wasn't properly initializing the model

### Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Model Loading Logic** (`backend/app.py`):

   - Improved path resolution by using `os.path.join()` consistently
   - Added better error handling for file access
   - Fixed the model path construction to use absolute paths

2. **Enhanced WSGI Configuration** (`backend/wsgi.py`):

   - Added model initialization at startup
   - Properly exported the Flask application for WSGI servers

3. **Created Startup Script** (`backend/start.py`):

   - Dedicated startup script for production deployment
   - Ensures model is loaded before server starts
   - Better logging for debugging deployment issues

4. **Updated Deployment Configuration**:
   - `render.yaml`: Updated to use the new startup script
   - `Procfile`: Updated to use the new startup script

### Files Modified

- `backend/app.py` - Fixed model loading logic
- `backend/wsgi.py` - Enhanced WSGI configuration
- `backend/start.py` - New startup script
- `backend/render.yaml` - Updated start command
- `backend/Procfile` - Updated start command

## Issue 2: Netlify 404 Error on Route Reload

### Problem

When users reloaded pages with routes like `/dashboard`, Netlify returned 404 errors because it was looking for physical files instead of handling client-side routing.

### Root Cause

- Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue
- Netlify didn't know how to handle client-side routes
- Missing redirect configuration

### Fixes Applied

1. **Created Netlify Redirects** (`public/_redirects`):

   - Added catch-all redirect to serve `index.html` for all routes
   - Returns 200 status code to maintain proper routing

2. **Added Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`):

   - Comprehensive Netlify configuration
   - Build settings and environment variables
   - Redirect rules for SPA routing

3. **Enhanced Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.js`):
   - Optimized build output
   - Proper asset handling
   - Development server configuration

### Files Created/Modified

- `public/_redirects` - Netlify redirect rules
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `vite.config.js` - Enhanced build configuration

## Testing the Fixes

### Backend Testing

1. Deploy to Render
2. Check logs for model loading success messages
3. Test the `/api/health` endpoint to verify model is loaded
4. Test the `/api/predict` endpoint with sample data

### Frontend Testing

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Navigate to different routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/about`)
3. Reload the page - should not show 404 error
4. Verify all routes work correctly

## Deployment Commands

### Backend (Render)

```bash
# The deployment will automatically use the updated configuration
# No additional commands needed
```

### Frontend (Netlify)

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
# The netlify.toml and _redirects files will handle the routing
```

## Verification Checklist

### Backend

- [ ] Model loads successfully on startup
- [ ] Health endpoint returns model status
- [ ] Prediction endpoint works correctly
- [ ] No "model not loaded" errors in logs

### Frontend

- [ ] All routes load correctly
- [ ] Page reloads work on any route
- [ ] No 404 errors on route navigation
- [ ] Build process completes successfully

## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Still Shows "Model Not Loaded"

1. Check Render logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify model files are present in the deployment
3. Check file permissions and paths
4. Test locally with the same configuration

### If Frontend Still Shows 404 on Reload

1. Verify `_redirects` file is in the `public` directory
2. Check `netlify.toml` configuration
3. Ensure build output includes the redirect files
4. Check Netlify build logs for errors
